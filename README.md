# Phishing Rules

This project aims to detect phishing URLs based on a set of predefined rules. The rules include checking for suspicious keywords, domains, and blacklisted URLs. This can be helpful in identifying potential phishing attacks and malicious websites.

## Features

- Detect suspicious keywords such as "login", "verify", "secure", "account", "update", etc., in URLs.
- Check for unusual top-level domains like `.xyz`, `.club`, `.top`, and `.tk`.
- Detect blacklisted domains to prevent known phishing websites.
- Simple command-line interface for testing URLs.
